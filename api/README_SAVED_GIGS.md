# Saved Gigs Implementation

This document provides information about the implementation of a separate database model for saved gigs.

## Overview

We've created a new MongoDB schema called `SavedGig` that stores relationships between users and their saved gigs. This approach replaces the previous implementation where saved gigs were stored as an array of IDs in the User model.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new `SavedGig` model with a compound index to ensure uniqueness
2. Added new API endpoints for saving/unsaving gigs and retrieving saved gigs
3. Updated frontend components to use the new API endpoints
4. Removed the old saved gigs functionality from the User model and API

## Migration

To migrate existing saved gigs data from the User model to the new SavedGig model, run the migration script:

```bash
cd /Users/gagan/Desktop/React\ Native/api
node utils/migrateSavedGigs.js
```

This script will:
1. Find all users with saved gigs in their User document
2. Create corresponding SavedGig documents for each saved gig
3. Report the number of migrated items and any errors

## New API Endpoints

### Get All Saved Gigs

```
GET /api/saved-gigs
```

Returns all gigs saved by the current user.

### Toggle Save/Unsave Gig

```
PUT /api/saved-gigs/toggle/:id
```

Toggles the saved status of a gig. If the gig is already saved, it will be unsaved, and vice versa.

### Check if Gig is Saved

```
GET /api/saved-gigs/check/:id
```

Checks if a specific gig is saved by the current user.

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Better Data Structure**: Follows proper database normalization principles
2. **Improved Performance**: More efficient queries for saved gigs
3. **Scalability**: Can easily add more metadata to saved gigs in the future
4. **Maintainability**: Cleaner code separation and dedicated API endpoints
